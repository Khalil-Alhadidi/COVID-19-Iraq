# COVID-19-Iraq
Simple C# console application to get the latest stats for COVID-19 situation in IRAQ


Calling a free API and prints the result back into the Console

Data is sourced from Johns Hopkins CSSE https://covid19api.com/ 

I used two libraries : 
 Newtonsoft.Json
and RestSharp

I used this awesome website http://json2csharp.com/ to create the json class
